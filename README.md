Bowling Game

In general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. For example, if a player bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down nine pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame. In the event that all ten pins are knocked over by a player in a single frame, bonuses are awarded.

Strike: When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an “X” on a score sheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins

The total score from these throws is:

Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19 Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
TOTAL = 28

A player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so:

Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike) Frame 3, ball 1: 4 pins
Frame 3, ball 2: 2 pins

The score from these throws are:

Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4) = 24 Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16 Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6
TOTAL = 46

The most points that can be scored in a single frame are 30 points (10 for the original strike, plus strikes in the two subsequent frames).

A player who bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls allowing the playing to gain bonus points. If both these balls also result in strikes, a total of 30 points (10 + 10 + 10) is awarded for the frame. These bonus points do not count on their own; they only count as the bonus for the strike.
